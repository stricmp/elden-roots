# elden-roots
Elden Roots is a side-scroller puzzle game developed at Global Game Jam 2023. A village's sacred source of life, known as the tree of fire, is attacked by an "unknown" force which reduces its flames, causing everyone in the village to disappear. In order to restore them, the player must rekindle the tree of fire by feeding her the correct roots.
